    <h2>Today's Topic: Hogwarts...or Hogwash?!</h2>

    <p>You may be thinking, &ldquo;I love Harry Potter! How could you say such a thing?!&rdquo; Newsflash sis, Hogwarts or "Hogwash" as I like to call it
        is no longer the industry staple in the world of magic.</p>

    <p><strong>There's a new kid on the block.</strong> The world of <em>Riot Games.</em> Riot has been <strong>developing some of the strongest
        narratives in the gaming and entertainment industry</strong> for quite some time now. For those who have been left behind or living under
        a rock, <em>I would highly reccommend getting engrossed in these narratives</em> and experiencing them for yourself. 

    <p>That's all for today everyone. Thanks for tuning in to read about <strong>rant on Riot Games and Harry Potter</strong>. As usual, <em>
        if you have any questions</em> please submit them to joshwritesgames@gmail.com. <strong>Thanks again for being a part of this community</strong>
